Arduino (nanode) code

More or less useful code for arduino.

I started with the Wicked Devices Nanode Gateway/Remote tutorial. I
couldn't getthe gateway stuff to work initially, but ended up getting
something that could send data to xively/pachube from the gateway in
the end, so worth putting this somewhere semi-permanent.

I still need to enumerate any of the libraries I need to make this
code work.

Next addition - probably the dzl metal detector code:

and/or stuff for monitoring pool status based on the Open Spa Monitor:
